<h1>Group 1 Application Project</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Our objective for this project was to create an application using the MERN stack. 
    The MERN stack consists of MONGODB, Express, React, and Node.js. We wanted to build 
    an application that allowed a user to create a profile with a unique user ID, and then
    can add a few items of information such as favorite food or color. 
</p>
<h3>The MERN Stack</h3>
<p>A Javascript stack that is used for quicker and easier development and deployment of applications. 
    It is essentially designed to make the development process smoother and easier.</p>
<h3>MongoDB</h3>
<p>An open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database (NoSQL means non-relational). NoSQL databases provide 
    excellent performance and are
     much more scalable compared to a SQL database. MongoDB adds more and more servers to increase the flexibility and productivity of its document model.</p>
<h3>Express</h3>
<p>A small framework that sits on top of a Node.js server. It helps simplify APIâ€™s and adds more helpful features, 
    as well as making it easier to organize the functionality of your application. It facilitates the rendering of the HTTP objects.</p>
<h3>React</h3>
<p>A component-based, open-source front end library that is only responsible for the view layer of the application. It is not a framework. It is a declarative 
    paradigm that simplifies the use of your application.</p>
<h3>Node.js</h3>
<p>An open-source environment for executing JavaScript outside of a browser. Most people make the mistake of understanding that it is a framework or programming language when it is not. It is used for building back-end services. It is easy to use, provides fast and very highly scalable services, and it uses JavaScript everywhere</p>
