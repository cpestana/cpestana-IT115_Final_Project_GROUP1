<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>Our objective for this project was to create an application using the MERN stack. 
    The MERN stack consists of MONGODB, Express, React, and Node.js. We wanted to build 
    an application that allowed a user to create a profile with a unique user ID, and then
    can add a few items of information such as favorite food or color. 
</p>
<h2>The MERN Stack</h2>
<p>A Javascript stack that is used for quicker and easier development and deployment of applications. 
    It is essentially designed to make the development process smoother and easier.</p>
<h2>MongoDB</h2>
<p>an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database (NoSQL means non-relational). NoSQL databases provide 
    excellent performance and are much more scalable compared to a SQL database. MongoDB adds more and more servers to increase the flexibility and productivity of its document model.</p>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p>a small framework that sits on top of a Node.js server. It helps simplify APIâ€™s and adds more helpful features, 
    as well as making it easier to organize the functionality of your application. It facilitates the rendering of the HTTP objects.</p>
